Metro Heights is a free-running/wall-running game inspired by the world of Blade Runner. The game was created as part of a Virtual Reality and 3D Games Module for my Computer Science Degree.

Most of it is junk, but feel free to use any of the scripts/assets you find. I spent a fair amount of time creating most assets from scratch and texturing them in Substance painter with 4K materials.

## Installation

Clone the project using Git/GitHub Desktop and open the project using Unity. Unfortunately, do to compatibility, I had to use Unity Version 2019.4.3 - so some of the newer Unity features couldn't be implemented.


## Contributing
As this was a University project, the repo is now un-maintained. However I will most likely create a brand new Metro Heights game in the future - this was essentially just a proof of concept for an assignment.
